# Lumbar-Spine-Degenerative-Classification
Developing an AI model with CNNs and Transfer Learning (ResNet, EfficientNet) to detect and classify five degenerative spine conditions from lumbar MRI scans by severity (Normal/Mild, Moderate, Severe). Integrating RAG with a pre-trained transformer for detailed explanations, using TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, and Nibabel.
